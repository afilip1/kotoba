# Kotoba
Kotoba is a simple programming language created with the purpose of learning the
intrinsics of language design and implementation. It is a C-like language supporting
the basic facilities expected from a programming language, such as variables,
functions, conditional flow, etc. It is dynamically typed and garbage collected.

"Kotoba" is Japanese for "word".
